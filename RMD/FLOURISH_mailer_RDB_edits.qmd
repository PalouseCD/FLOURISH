## Here's your data!

Hi `r producer_name`, here is a summary of the data from the soil moisture sensor in your cover crop field from `r FIRST_DATE` to `r LAST_DATE`. If your graphs have very different numbers at the start of the time period or odd horizontal jogs in data, disregard those. As the project continues we will be working on finding the best way to get your data to you, so please don't hesitate to offer up questions or comments on how it is displayed. Feel free to reach out to Gerrit (gerritb\@palousecd.org) or Ryan (ryanb\@palousecd.org) with any questions or comments!
