## Here's your data!

Hi `r producer_name`, here is a summary of the data from the soil moisture sensor in your cover crop field from `r FIRST_DATE` to `r LAST_DATE`. Feel free to reach out to Gerrit (gerritb\@palousecd.org) or Ryan (ryanb\@palousecd.org) with any questions pertaining to your data!

## Soil Moisture in your field at 1 and 3 feet

```{r Soil M graph, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# soil moisture graph
                      
```

## Soil Temperature in your field at 1 and 3 feet

```{r Soil Tempgraph, echo=F, warning=FALSE}

#soil temperature graph

```
